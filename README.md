 Multivariate k-Motiflets

This repository contains the implementation of Multivariate k-Motiflets
a tool for detecting and visualizing motifs in multivariate time series data.
Motifs are recurring patterns that can provide valuable insights in different areas.
This implementation builds on the great work of Dr. Patrick Sch√§fer and Prof. Dr. Ulf Leser for univariate time series,
